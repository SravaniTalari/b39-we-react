Web application vs Website

A website becomes webapp when user interacts with it and affect other people experience
 or their own experience.
Eg : you tube  - user interaction affect his own and others experience --> thus webapp

Websites are static , cannot affect others with their interaction --> eg: profile Websites

Eg : Amazon.com --> webapp
webapps --> dynamic and harder to develop.

React is to solve the problem of webapp. 

Features of React :
1.SPA (single page apps/applications) : react popularised SPA --> better user experience

### React 
Rules to creste component:
1.Function should start with  a capital letter
2.It should return at least on JSX element.

    let name = "Sravani"
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>
                Hi {name}
            </h1>
        </div>
    );
}
